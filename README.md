## 1. Sum of Multiples Problem

### Problem  
Find the sum of all natural numbers below **N** that are multiples of **3 or 5**.

### Input  
- First line: number of test cases **t**  
- Next **t** lines: each line contains integer **N**

### Output  
- For each test case, print the sum of multiples.

### Sample Input  
2
10
100
### Sample Output  
23
2318

## 2. Even Fibonacci Sum

### Problem  
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.  
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed **N**, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Input  
- First line: number of test cases **t**  
- Next **t** lines: each line contains integer **N**

### Output  
- For each test case, print the sum of even Fibonacci numbers.

### Sample Input  
2
10
100
### Sample Output  
10
44
